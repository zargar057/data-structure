Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples**\n","Mutable data types can be changed after they are created, like a list where you can add or remove items. Immutable data types cannot be changed once they are created, like a string or a number — if you want to change them, you have to make a new one. For example, lists are mutable because you can do my_list.append(4), but strings are immutable because you can’t change part of a string directly.\n","#my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n","#.append(4)  # Now it's [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","#list is mutable because we changed it.\n","#my_name = \"John\"\n","#my_name = \"Jack\"  # This creates a new string, it doesn't change the old one\n","#string is immutable because you can’t change part of it — only replace it."],"metadata":{"id":"2WrFMRqKINuk"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?**\n","ans. (a)Lists and tuples are both used to store a group of items in Python.\n","(b)Lists can be changed.
